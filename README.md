# clothStore

I'm currently working on this!

If you want to see the progress so far, you can follow the below commands:

1. Clone this repo :
```
git clone https://github.com/aditya8Raj/clothstore.git
```

2. I have not hosted the server, so :
```
cd client
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm (make sure you have node.js installed) :
```
npm install
```

4. Start the app :
```
npm start
```
